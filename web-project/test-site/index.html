        <h2 id="headline">About</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Nicholas Azenui Asanga but my friends call me Lil Nick. I am a Cameroonian aged 26. I hold a BSc in Geography from the University of Buea , Cameroon (2014) and in March, 2019 in Graduated with a MSc in Geospatial Technologies
            from NOVA university of Lisbon Portugal, Jaume university of Cateleon Spain, and the University of Munstr, Germany (it was a joint Erasmus Master program in partnership with these three universities). I am curently livng in Dormund, Germany
            and i am very excited to be relocating to the Netherlands.</p>

        <h2>Why Codaisseur?</h2>
        <p> In the course of my mater program (Geospatial technologies), i worked on class projects that required knowledge of coding in order to achieve good output. Having no prior knowledge, i faced a lot of difficulties in doing my class projects which
            affected my performance. Seeing how important coding was, i made it a task to focus on coding after my graduation, gain new skill that i can apply to what i studied in my masters. After doing some online courses and some research i found out
            that Web development could be a perfect match for my career path and i found Codaisseur a perfect place to get such skills. In this regard i beleive i am very motivated and i cant wait to take this chalange.</p>
